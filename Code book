This is the code book that decribe the differnets files that are the result of the analysis. 

The first described is the text file that are writte, activitiesMean.

The column are the subject, there is 30 column 
The line are as follow 
6 times 66 mesures, 
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

That are the 66 measures that comes 6 times 
First set is the mean of this mesure for each subject for the activity walking
The second set is the mean of this mesure for each subject for the activity walking upstairs
The third set is the mean of this mesure for each subject for the activity walking downstairs
The fourth set is the mean of this mesure for each subject for the activity sitting
The fith set is the mean of this mesure for each subject for the activity standing
The sixth set is the mean of this mesure for each subject for the activity laying

The other data that are into are created in the script run_analysis is called subMergedData ti is a data frame. The columns are:
